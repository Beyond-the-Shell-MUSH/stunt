This is the source code for a slightly hacked version of the GNU
`gperf' program, for generating perfect hash tables useful in quickly
looking up keywords.  Pavel hacked the source to add a `-I' flag that
makes the generated hash table case-insensitive; this was required in
order to use it for the MOO programming language.  Todd hacked the
source so that it used the more modern stdarg rather than varargs.

If you ever try to change the set of keywords in the MOO, you'll need
a working version of this program in order to recreate the
`keywords.c' file from `keywords.gperf'.
