+This code allows you more control of DNS lookups, and for the DNS
+lookups to use forked processes instead of blocking the entire MOO.
+
+Some people think that the MOO does name lookups in the background by
+default, since it uses two subprocesses for them. But actually it's
+just sandboxing the gethostbyname() call so that it can kill it with a
+timeout without leaving the resolver library in an inconsistent state.
